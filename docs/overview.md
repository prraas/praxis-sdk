# 🤖 Praxis - Overview

### **Robotics Reasoning as a Service (RRaaS)**

Praxis is a **cloud-based execution layer for robotics computation and physical reasoning**.

It enables developers, researchers, and autonomous systems to execute **navigation logic, physics evaluation, simulation checks, and structured robotic reasoning** in a **remote, deterministic, and reproducible environment** - independent of local machines, hardware differences, or fragile execution setups.

Praxis is not a framework or a simulator.
It is **infrastructure**.

This document explains **what Praxis is**, **why it exists**, and **how it fits into modern robotics and agent-based systems**.

## ❓ The Core Problem in Robotics Computation

Robotics computation today is **environment-bound**.

Across labs, startups, and individual developers:

* hardware setups vary widely
* execution environments differ subtly
* numerical results drift across machines
* experiments are difficult to reproduce
* scaling beyond a single system is painful

Even when **source code is shared**, the **execution context is not**.

As a result:

* collaboration becomes fragile
* verification is difficult
* results cannot be trusted externally
* robotics workflows remain machine-dependent

In practice, most robotics computation today is:

> **“Works on my machine” compute**

This is acceptable for experimentation -
but unacceptable for **production systems, shared research, autonomous agents, or paid intelligence services**.

Praxis exists to close this execution gap.

---

## 🎯 What Praxis Solves

Praxis standardizes **how robotics computation is executed**.

Instead of embedding execution inside:

* local simulators
* custom scripts
* hardware-coupled environments

Praxis provides a **controlled, remote execution layer** where:

* computation runs in a consistent environment
* results are deterministic
* execution cost is explicit
* outputs are traceable and verifiable

You send **intent and inputs**.
Praxis handles **execution**.
You receive **verifiable outputs**.

This separation allows robotics computation to scale, repeat, and integrate cleanly with modern software systems.

## 🧩 What Praxis Is

Praxis is:

* ☁️ A **remote execution layer** for robotics logic
* 🔁 A **deterministic compute service** for navigation, physics, and simulation
* 🧠 An **API-first platform** designed for programmatic access
* ⚙️ A **supporting infrastructure layer** beneath agents and robotics systems
* 🌱 A **shared platform** intended to be reused, extended, and integrated

Praxis is designed to work **alongside existing robotics stacks**, not replace them.

---

## 🚫 What Praxis Is Not

Praxis is **not**:

* a robotics framework
* a simulator UI or visualization tool
* a local development environment
* a replacement for ROS, Gazebo, PyBullet, MuJoCo, or similar tools

You continue to:

* write your own robotics logic
* choose your own models and abstractions
* design higher-level system behavior

Praxis is concerned with **reliable execution**, not author avoiding.

---

## 🧠 Core Design Principles

### 🔁 Determinism First

Identical inputs must always produce identical outputs.

Determinism is critical for:

* debugging complex systems
* validating results
* reproducible research
* collaborative robotics development
* agent verification and economic settlement

Hidden randomness and silent environment drift are treated as defects.

---

### ⚙️ Execution Over Tooling

Praxis does not dictate **how robotics logic is written**.

Its responsibility is limited to:

* executing computation
* returning results
* doing so predictably and transparently

This separation keeps Praxis:

* minimal
* composable
* long-term maintainable

---

### 🔍 Transparency Over Abstraction

Every execution returns:

* the computed result
* the execution cost
* a unique request identifier

This enables:

* traceability
* cost awareness
* auditing and debugging
* external verification

No execution is opaque.
Nothing is silently hidden.

---

### 🌍 Shared Infrastructure Over Lock-In

Praxis is designed to be:

* readable
* extensible
* understandable

The goal is to create **shared infrastructure for robotics computation**, not a closed ecosystem.

Praxis prioritizes **interoperability over capture** avoiding proprietary lock-in.

---

## 🧭 Supported Computation Domains

Praxis currently focuses on core robotics computation domains:

* 🧭 **Navigation and path planning**
* ⚙️ **Physics evaluation**
* 🧪 **Simulation and validation**
* 🔗 **Multi-step and agent-style workflows**

Each domain is exposed through:

* a stable API surface
* a consistent SDK interface
* deterministic execution semantics

New domains can be added without breaking existing integrations.

---

## 🏗 How Praxis Fits Into a Robotics Stack

Praxis acts as a **supporting execution layer**, not the center of the system.

Typical integration:

```
Your Robotics Code
        ↓
Praxis SDK
        ↓
Remote Execution Engine
        ↓
Deterministic Result + Cost + Trace
```

You retain:

* control over system architecture
* ownership of models and logic
* freedom in tooling choices

Praxis provides **execution consistency and verifiability**.

---

## 👥 Intended Users

Praxis is built for:

* robotics developers
* research laboratories
* autonomous systems teams
* agent-based system builders
* engineers focused on reproducibility
* teams scaling experimentation and validation

If offering robotics computation as a **reliable, shareable, or paid service** matters, Praxis is designed for that use case.

---

## 📌 Summary

Praxis provides a **reliable, deterministic, and transparent execution layer** for robotics computation.

By separating execution from local environments, Praxis enables teams to:

* scale experimentation
* collaborate reliably
* verify results externally
* reason clearly about cost and behavior

Praxis exists to make **robotics computation execution a shared, dependable primitive**.
